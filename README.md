# WSO2 IoT Docker Resources

This repository contains following Docker resources:

- WSO2 IoT Server Dockerfile
- WSO2 IoT Analytics Dockerfile
- WSO2 IoT Broker Dockerfile
- WSO2 IoT Docker Compose Templates

The WSO2 IoT Server, IoT Analytics and IoT Broker Dockerfiles build generic Docker images <br>
for deploying IoT Server, Analytics and Broker in containerized environments. They<br>
include the JDK, product distributions and a collection of utility libraries. Configurations, JDBC<br>
driver, extensions and other deployable artifacts are designed to be provided via volume mounts.

The Docker Compose templates have been created according to standard IoT deployment patterns
for allowing users to evaluate the product and understand the deployment architecture in depth.
